create-bordered-9-patch
=======================

A very small utility to create 9-patch png images with borders, created at a time when I hade to implement a layout with borders here and there in an Android app.

Example of usage
----------------
   * Black image with white borders left and right: `./create-bordered-9-patch.rb 000000 ff0000 LR`
   * Semitransparent red image with green border all around: ` ./create-bordered-9-patch.rb ff0000aa 00ff00 LRTB`
